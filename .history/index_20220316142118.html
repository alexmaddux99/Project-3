				<h2>How to Get a Free Meal.</h2>
				<p>Even if your options are limited and your pockets are turned inside out, you can still
				rustle up some grub.

				Consider several ways to feed yourself without begging or stealing.
				You will need Fast food shops Grocery store coupons Local bars with happy hours Nature
				preserves Public functions Restaurants Charitable organizations and blood drives.
				
				<h1>Step 1.</h1>
				
				Find or ask for free meal coupons from Mcdonald's, the Cracker Barrel, and other restaurants.
				Look for scratch-off cards and contests to win free food.

				<h1>Step 2.</h1>

				Search for local restaurants that offer free birthday meals -- usually supplied only if
				you are accompanied by a friend who buys their own.
				Some honor veterans, women, and seniors on certain days of the year.

				<h1>Step 3.</h1>

				Hang out at bars during happy hour.
				Buy a cheap drink for the opportunity to feast for a couple hours.

				<h1>Step 4.</h1>

				Crash wedding receptions, wakes, church functions, company picnics, and public promotional giveaways.
				Tour major food stores on weekends for promotional sample displays that might comprise a full
				meal when you're done.
				Stick around a friend's home until you overstay your welcome or clean out their pantry.

				<h1>Step 5.</h1>

				Volunteer to help a charitable organization and you can usually get fed, because there
				is no other pay.
				Donate blood, as well, for which you will be given sustenance afterward, and still feel
				good about what you've done to help others.

				<h1>Step 6.</h1>

				Scavenge in the woods for wild edibles that you can take home, and cook.
				Hunt for game if you don't mind cleaning and cooking it.

				<h1>Step 7.</h1>
				
				Grow your own garden to get quality, fresh, and safe food at little cost.
				Did you know As of 2008, Americans waste 27 percent of consumables every year, or 30 million
				tons of food, as recently as 2008.</p>
